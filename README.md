# Lead_Scoring_Case_Study
Building a Logistic Regression Model for Calculating Lead Score

Problem Statement:
1. X Education sells online courses to industry professionals.
2. X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. For example, if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted.
3. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’.
4. If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.

Objective:
This analysis is done for X Education and to find ways to get more industry professionals to join their courses. The basic data provided gave us a lot of information about how the potential customers visit the site, the time they spend there, how they reached the site and the conversion rate.
